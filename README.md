This is the Verbose Pebble Watchface.  It includes the day of the week, day of the month, month, and year.  The face font is built from Microsoft Cooper Black.  I have not included that font in Github.  You will need to supply it yourself if you are rebuilding the Watchface.

The Watchface only imports the exact characters needed to render the display.  It also only updates the portion of the display that has changed.
